#8 Website Design Guidelines for an Exceptional User Experience
###1. Simplicity

While the look and feel of your website is important, most visitors aren't coming to your site to evaluate how slick the design is. Instead, they're coming to your site to complete some action, or to find some specific piece of information.

Adding unnecessary design elements (*i.e., elements that serve no functional purpose*) to your website will only make it harder for visitors to accomplish what they're trying to accomplish.

From a usability and UX perspective, simplicity is your friend. And you can employ simplicity in a variety of different ways. Here are some examples:

*    Colors. Don't use too many. The Handbook of Computer-Human Interaction recommends using a maximum of five (*plus or minus two*) different colors in your website's design.
*    Typefaces. The typefaces you choose should be legible at the very least. And when it comes to colors, you shouldn't use too many. A common recommendation is to use a maximum of three different typefaces in a maximum of three different sizes.
*    Graphics. Only use them if they'll help a user complete a task or perform a specific function (*don't just add graphics willy-nilly*).


###2. Visual Hierarchy

Closely tied to the principle of simplicity, visual hierarchy entails arranging and organizing website elements so that visitors naturally gravitate toward the most important elements first.

Remember, when it comes to optimizing for usability and UX, the goal is to lead visitors to complete a desired action, but in a way that feels natural and enjoyable. By adjusting the position, color, or size of certain elements, you can structure your site in such a way that visitors will be drawn to those elements first.

In the example below from [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/), you can see that the "Get Spotify Free" call-to-action sits atop the visual hierarchy. For starters, it's positioned on the left of the page (most visitors scan websites from left to right). What's more, it's the only element above the fold that uses that dark purple color, which naturally draws your attention.

###3. Navigability

Having intuitive navigation on your site is crucial for ensuring visitors can find what they're looking for. Ideally, a visitor should be able to arrive on your site and not have to think extensively about where they should click next -- moving from point A to point B should be as pain-free as possible.

Here are a few tips for optimizing your site's navigation:

*    Keep the structure of your primary navigation simple (and near the top of your page).
*    Include navigation in the footer of your site.
*    Use breadcrumbs on every page (except for the homepage) so people are aware of their navigation trail.
*    Include a search box near the top of your site so visitors can search by keywords.
*    Don't offer too many navigation options on a page.
*    Don't dig too deep. In most cases, itâ€™s best to keep your navigation to no more than three levels deep. (Check out this article for more clarity around flat vs. deep navs.)
*    Include links within your page copy, and make it clear where those links lead to.

Another pointer: Once you've settled on what your site's main (top) navigation will be, keep it consistent. The labels and location of your navigation should remain the same on each and every page of your site. Here's an example from the InVision website:
